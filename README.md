# Hubot Twilio Adapter

**charlesjolley:** Minor edits to work with latest node APIs, etc.

## Description

This is the [Twilio](http://twilio.com) adapter for hubot that allows you to
send an SMS to your Hubot and he will send an SMS back with the response.

## Installation

* Add `hubot-twilio` as a dependency in your hubot's `package.json`
* Install dependencies with `npm install`
* Run hubot with `bin/hubot -a twilio`

### Note if running on Heroku

You will need to change the process type from `app` to `web` in the `Procfile`.

## Usage

You will need to set some environment variables to use this adapter.

### Heroku

    % heroku config:add HUBOT_SMS_FROM="+14156662671"

    % heroku config:add HUBOT_SMS_SID="AC5d10e5624da757326d12f8d31c08c20b"

    % heroku config:add HUBOT_SMS_TOKEN="4ada63e18146a204e468fb6289030231"

### Non-Heroku environment variables

    % export HUBOT_SMS_FROM="+14156662671"

    % export HUBOT_SMS_SID="AC5d10e5624da757326d12f8d31c08c20b"

    % export HUBOT_SMS_TOKEN="4ada63e18146a204e468fb6289030231"

Then you will need to set the HTTP endpoint on Twilio to point to your server
and make sure the request type is set to `GET`. The endpoint should have 
```/hubot/sms``` as the path.
